# SPT-CoveredUpArmpits
For body armor and chest rigs, the front soft thorax armor will now cover the armpit hitboxes.

## **Overview**
In SPT 3.9, the armpit hitboxes are covered by insertable ballistic front plates but they are not covered by unremovable soft armor.  This matters for players in early-game that are using rigs with only soft armor like the 6B3TM-01 and find themselves getting one-tapped in the thorax via a bullet into the armpit.  This mod expands the hitboxes in the front soft armor for all body armor/chest rigs to cover the armpit hitboxes.  In addition to this, if a body armor/chest rig does not have any side protection like the 6B2 body armor, the front soft armor will also cover the hitboxes on the lower left and lower right sides of the thorax.

## **Background**
I made this mod due to finding early-wipe gameplay extremely captivating except for occasionally getting one-tapped by ammo run by scavs and low-level PMCs.  Although insertable plates protect the armpits in the current version of SPT, it can take a while before a player can upgrade to those rigs reliably if they are doing something like a FM-less run.

## **Install**
Extract directly into the SPT folder.  The plugin can be located in user/mods/.
